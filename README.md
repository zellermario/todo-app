# A React Todo application

## Dependencies
The app requires React to function, it can be intalled with `npm install -g react` using npm.<br />
The app uses Bulma and FontAwesome to render the UI. To avoid complications, for now these are fetched from the internet, so an active internet connection is needed to properly render the app.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and enter the folder<br />
`git clone https://github.com/zellermario/todo-app`<br />
`cd todo-app`<br /><br />
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.<br /><br />
3. To enter live development mode, run `npm start`.<br />
To build the app for use, run `npm run build`. The built app then will be output to `./build`.
